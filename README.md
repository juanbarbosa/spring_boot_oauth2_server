# Hello Internet
Few Examples of getting Spring Boot 2 (Spring 5) to run an OAuth2 Server.
At the time of this writting, there's only one though... (more soon-ish, working on the next one at the moment)

Projects:
   1. OAuth2_Server_For_DevPrototyping_APIs: Code template is taken from Chapter 7 from the excellent book Spring Microservices in Action. Written by John Carnell, Published by Manning. John Carnell's original code for the book is also on GitHub https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter7/tree/master/authentication-service. Code has minor tweaks, and improvements and its stripped down to the essential code to setup the server.
   
   2. OAuth2_Server_w_Config_In_Db: [Not Committed yet] Is a step forwards from 1. Where all the hardcoding from the source code has been removed and pushed into the database, and get one step closer to production level quality.
