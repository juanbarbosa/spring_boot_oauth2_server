Few Demos of getting Spring Boot 2 (Spring 5) to run an OAuth2 Server.
At the time of this writting, there's only one though...

Full Dislaimer:
Code template is taken from Chapter 7 from the excellent book Spring Microservices in Action. Written by John Carnell, Published by Manning. John Carnell's original code for the book is also on GitHub https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter7/tree/master/authentication-service.

Reason why this code is here is because:
   1) I'm teaching myself spring, I found that the code did not work on my STS 4 (Spring Tool Suite 4), because it needed a bit of tweaking. So, I'm trying to help other newbies such as me, so they avoid the struggle.
   2) Also, John's repo for this example has a lot on uncessary code that, I consider, would distract from the code that really matters to illustrate this example.
   3) Add other examples over time that I think would improve upon this template and make it better.
