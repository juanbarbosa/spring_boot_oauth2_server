Updated code to work with spring-boot-starter-parent version 2.1.4.RELEASE
Since I couldn't get it to work as is in my Spring Tool Suite 4 environment as is.

Example taken from Chapter 7 of the book Spring Microservices in Action by John Carnell. Published by Manning.
Code has been slightly updated and from what is on his github page
  (https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter7/tree/master/authentication-service)
and turned into a bare bones version, where only what is necessary to illustrate the example 
for that chapter is included.

Code is good for prototyping apis, after the api has been secured.

If you have the book handy, please refer to pictures 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 to use.
