Updated code to work with spring-boot-starter-parent version 2.1.4.RELEASE
Since I couldn't get it to work as is in my Spring Tool Suite 4 environment as is.

Example from Spring Microservices in Action by John Carnell from chapter 7.
Code has been slightly updated and from what is on his github page
  (https://github.com/carnellj/spmia-chapter7/tree/master/authentication-service)
and turned into a bare bones version, where only what is necessary to illustrate the example 
for that chapter is included.

Code is good for prototyping apis, after the api has been secured.
